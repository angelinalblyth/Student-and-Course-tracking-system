Create a Student and Course tracking system.

## MVP

- Create an `Student` class.
- `Student` should have `First Name`, `Last Name`, `Age` and a `enrolment_number`.
- Create a `Course` class.
- `Course` should have a `title` and an Enum for `level` (BENG, BSC, BA, etc)
- Annotate the and `Course` getter in `Student` with `@ManyToOne` annotations.
- Change `Course` so that it has a `List<Student> students` property.
- In `Course` add `OneToMany` association to `students` property. This should have attribute of `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` and be mapped to course property of the `Student` class.
- Write the CRUD functions in a `DBHelper` class. (`save`, `update`, `delete`, `getAll` and `find`)
- Write a method in a `DBCourse` class to return a list of all students on the course.
